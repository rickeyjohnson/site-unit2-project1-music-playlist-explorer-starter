    - For example, navigating to the all playlists page and then back to the featured playlist page should result in a new random playlist being displayed
    - Note that because your algorithm will not be truly random, it is possible that the same playlist will feature twice in a row. 
    - [ ] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself refreshing the featured page more than once.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete? 

Yes and no, just enough for basics, but not enough for the streatch features for example inputs and forms.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc. 

I would've made it more prettier and interactive. I would've definetly do more stretch features.  

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My demo when well, I talked, it felt natural and all my MVP features were cool.
